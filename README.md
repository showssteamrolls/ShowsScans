# ShowsScans

**ShowsScans** tracks health inspections from 2010–2025, showing failure trends, inspection volume, and which facilities fail most.

## Problem Statement
Health inspections are meant to keep people safe, but failure rates change a lot depending on the month, facility type, and how many inspections happen. This dashboard spots patterns, seasonal shifts, and the facilities that fail most — giving a clear view of where risks are higher.

## Features
- Monthly inspection failure trends
- Inspection volume vs. failure rates
- Facility types with highest failure rates
- Interactive filters by year and facility type
